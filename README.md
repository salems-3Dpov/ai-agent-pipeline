# ai-agent-pipeline: Production-Ready AI Workflows with LangChain, LangGraph, LangSmith and Observability

![Releases badge](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/salems-3Dpov/ai-agent-pipeline)
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/salems-3Dpov/ai-agent-pipeline/releases)

A production-ready AI agent pipeline that uses LangChain for LLM workflows, LangGraph for agent orchestration, and LangSmith for observability. It supports document processing, weather queries, and general Q&A with built-in monitoring and debugging. The project focuses on reliability, observability, and developer ergonomics, so teams can build robust AI pipelines with clear tracing, testing, and deployment paths.

Why this project
- Clear separation of concerns: LLM workflows (LangChain) are decoupled from orchestration (LangGraph) and observability (LangSmith). This makes it easier to evolve parts of the system without breaking the whole stack.
- Production readiness: The pipeline includes monitoring, tracing, and debugging hooks out of the box. It’s designed for reliability, fault tolerance, and maintainability.
- Document processing first: The system ships with a PDF document processor, OCR considerations, and embedding storage to support search and retrieval.
- Weather and general Q&A: It provides a structured way to answer weather questions from OpenWeatherMap API and support general knowledge queries with robust context handling.
- Extensibility: The architecture is designed to plug in new data sources, new LLM providers, or new UI layers without rewriting core logic.

Core concepts and architecture
- LangChain for LLM workflows: Chains, prompts, memory, and agents are assembled to perform complex reasoning tasks, document extraction, and question answering.
- LangGraph for orchestration: A graph-based orchestrator that coordinates multiple agents, fragments tasks, handles retries, and routes results to downstream components.
- LangSmith for observability: End-to-end tracing, logging, data lineage, and debugging dashboards help you identify bottlenecks and misconfigurations quickly.
- Document processing pipeline: Import, parse, transform, embed, and store documents (including PDFs) for fast retrieval and QA over content.
- Weather data integration: Connect to OpenWeatherMap API to answer weather-related questions with up-to-date data.
- General Q&A: A robust QA flow that uses context windows, memory, and retrieval from vector stores to provide informed answers.
- Observability-first development: Emphasis on monitoring, error handling, metrics, and traces to reduce production incidents.

How the pipeline works
- Input ingestion
  - Text, PDFs, or structured data are ingested through a simple interface
  - PDFs go through a document extractor to identify text blocks, headings, and metadata
- Document processing and indexing
  - Document content is cleaned, tokenized, and embedded
  - Embeddings are stored in a vector store such as ChromaDB
  - Metadata, sources, and content links are preserved for provenance
- Embeddings and retrieval
  - Vector embeddings support semantic search
  - Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) uses relevant context for answers
- LLM-driven workflows
  - LangChain orchestrates prompts, chains, and memory
  - The pipeline builds context-aware prompts for questions over documents or general knowledge
- Orchestration with LangGraph
  - Complex tasks are split into sub-tasks
  - Agents coordinate to fetch data, compute results, and handle retries
- Observability with LangSmith
  - Each step publishes traces, metrics, and logs
  - Debug sessions can replay requests and inspect intermediate results
  - Dashboards provide insights into latency, errors, and throughput
- Weather data flows
  - Weather queries call OpenWeatherMap API
  - Data is parsed, validated, and incorporated into responses
  - Custom weather checks help validate data quality and handle outages
- General Q&A
  - The Q&A flow leverages a combination of document context and external knowledge
  - If needed, the system asks clarifying questions or retrieves additional context
